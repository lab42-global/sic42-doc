Hi everyone,

We are approaching the final week of the SIC beta phase. For that we got a visit from Santa Clause in the wintery Davos with some Apple gift cards in his bag for the best contributions in the
final competition week. Head over to our [website](https://lab42.global/sic/) for more information and [join](https://lab42.global/sic/registration/) the swarm intelligence cup if you
have not already done so. Creating an agent to compete can easily be done with a few spare hours on the next weekend, remember if you'd still like to participate in a training round [submit](https://lab42.global/sic/submission/)
your first code until Dec., 03.

In the first week of the SIC we already saw some action with "Attacker" taking the top spot on our [leaderboard](https://lab42.global/sic/leaderboard/) followed by BumbleBees1708:

For this week we have a video with a new environment and task called "Supplies Hunt" for you. The development of truly intelligent systems depends on their ability to handle a wide range of tasks in different environments. 
SIC42 is an ideal testing ground for this, as it provides a platform that covers a wide range of tasks and environments. Check out the video below:

As you can see we've also been busy working at the visualization to show the actions agents take and things they carry around. We'll soon provide you with an updated package including these changes!

With that happy coding over the weekend and I hope we'll see a lot of cool contributions to our project,

Hansueli
