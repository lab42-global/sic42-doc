This is the documentation for the sic42 package. It is a work in progress and will be expanded as the beta phase runs. You can help us improve it by submitting pull requests on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lab42-global/sic42-doc).

## How to get started

To get started with the sic42 package head over to our [quick start](/quick-start/) section. If you'd like to learn more about the Swarm Intelligence Cup (SIC) you can go to our [website](https://lab42.global/sic/).
